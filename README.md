# Visualising English COVID-19 Cases with Topological Data Analysis

This repository contains a Python-based implementation and exploration of the study  
**“Visualising the Evolution of English Covid-19 Cases with Topological Data Analysis Ball Mapper”** by Dlotko and Rudkin (2020).  
The project applies *Topological Data Analysis* (TDA) to understand how COVID-19 case patterns evolved across English regions using socio-economic indicators.

## 📘 Overview

The Ball Mapper method provides a topological summary of high-dimensional data by representing it as a network of overlapping balls.  
Here, each ball captures a group of regions with similar socio-economic profiles. By colouring these balls according to COVID-19 case intensity, the method reveals structural relationships that are hard to see with traditional plots.

This project reproduces and extends the results of the original paper using an entirely Python toolchain.
